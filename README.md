# Varsity_Pharmacy_Windows_Form

## This is a windows form pharmacy system.

### Project Description.

The project that is being developed is about the point-of-sale system integrated with the inventory 
control system for the pharmacy. The name of this pharmacy is Varsity Pharmacy, located near the 
Varsity where the target market is located. This project will help a lot when it comes to saving time, 
money, and effort in work. This project will help the staff by being able to do things easily, fast, and 
safely. 

The purpose of this project is to boost the pharmacy's productivity, increase revenue and ensure 
accurate procedures. It will allow staff to easily register their customers to store their details on the 
database for later use. The inventory control system will count the stoke of the business with accurate 
numbers. It will be easy to trace the activities of the pharmacy.
This project will consist of a POS system that will enable staff to register their customers by collecting 
details such as Name, Surname, Age, Gender, ID Number, Phone number, Email Address, and Medical 
Aid details. After collecting this information, they will know what certain customers need most of the 
time and what most customers buy from the pharmacy.

At the same time, the inventory control system will count the stock, count how many products are 
being sold, and how many products are being received from the supplier so that they will calculate 
input vs output in a better way and get an accurate balance. This system will allow the staff to control 
their inventory, by (CRUD) adding, viewing, updating, and archiving/deleting the product on the 
database. 

This project will have six sub-systems for managing customer details, supplier details, placing orders, 
managing product details, and capturing payments. To manage customer details, the system will 
manage customer details by receiving details from the customer and storing it in the database by staff 
members. To manage supplier details, the system will collect details and store them in the database 
and be able to send orders to the supplier. The place order system will place an order for the customer, 
receive product details from the product datastore, store order details in the data store, store payment 
in the data store, receive payment from the customer, calculate the total order price, and available 
show products. The capture payment system will be able to capture the order details from the data 
store and capture the payment. The whole system will consist of three entities: the customer, staff,
and supplier.

The whole project will take about approximately 7-8 months to complete. The tools to develop this 
system will be MS Project to estimate time and have better time management, MS Visual Studio to 
develop the whole system, MS Visio for diagrams drawings, and MS SQL Server Management Studio
to store data of the system.
